                <div class="contentone">Excited to see what this semester will bring. My experience with JavaScript is limited, so I'm hoping I continue to become more comfortable with the language this semester. Prior to last fall, the idea of "coding" had always been very intimidating. At my first job in marketing after my undergraduate studies at Hamilton College, I learned some very very basic html for our e-Blasts. Two years later, I moved to NYC where I landed a role in sales for an influencer marketing company. I befriended many of the members on the product team whose chatter regarding their work sounded like a foreign language to me. However, upon learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript last semester, I realized that in fact, I too, could learn a new language. And maybe one day I can parktake in those conversations.

                    <li> <b>How much doing experience do you have?</b> As I mentioned above, my coding experience is limited to what I learned during my first semester of this program; HTML, CSS, and a 1.5 month introduction to JavaScript.</li>
                    <li> <b>What do you hope to get from this class?</b> I am hoping to keep fine tuning my coding skills this semester via the execution of my creative ideas. What I enjoyed most about designing via HTML and CSS last semester was practicing how to design effectively within the limitations of HMTL and CSS. My background is painting, which is loosey goosey and allows for endless number of strokes, colors, layers, etc.  Have restaints in HTML and CSS forced me to focus on concept while executing the idea via a simple, functional design.

              <div class="contenttwo">Prior to today's class I knew very little about the history of the internet. A bit of information here a there, but honestly, not much. Recently, I've started thinking more and more about the impact of the internt on my own life -- particularly how it is impacting my relationships with those to whom I'm close. I'm wondering how having access to so much information is sculpting who I am and how interact with others. Because of this, the history of the internet has suddenly become much more intereting to me. I had no idea these massive computers lived at Google. The idea that a little fan turns on every time I create a Google slide or send an email is nearly incomprehensible, just because of how frequently I perform these tasks.

              <div class="contentthree">I am obsessed with Rafaël Rozendaal's Abstract Browsing concept. His idea was so simple, yet so effective. I recently became interested in the concept of minimalism after moving into my own apartment for the first time last fall. I had the opportunity to decorate my apartment, a 420 sq foot studio with four floor to ceiling windows looking out onto all of Brooklyn south of South 1st Street. The space gets fantastic light and has ample storage space, which has allowed me to store non-essentials while keeping my living space tidy. What I've enjoyed most, though, has been the opportunity to carefully decorate and curate a space designed entirely by me. As a painter, I've had a tendency throughout most of my life to fill my spaces with lots stuff, including piles of art supplies. I'm naturally a non-linear thinking, which means that the excess clutter throughout my life has further muffled my ability to take care of day to day tasks efficently and with ease. For example. When I need to brush my teeth, I'll walk to the bathroom, but then get distracted by the book I left on my nightstand and then by the plant hanging from my wall that needs watering (immediately). Oh no, and I just received a text from a classmate about an assingment that I should probably respond to ASAP so I don't forget about it. By the time I've reached the bathroom, I've watered my plant, responded to the text, and my book is somehow in my left hand. Here we are, toothbrush in mouth, 10 minutes later. <br><br>  I can't help but believe my design studies, which intersected with my move last fall, have contributed to my interest in minimalism. Functionality is a key element of design and as well as specificially in minimalism. So, in order to embark on my minimalism journey, I've been attempting to get rid of things I dont use, remove distractions from life i.e., setting screen time limits on my phone, and getting creative with the way I utilize my 420 sq feet. Wall storage is a must.<br><br> Now, I've mentioned all of this because Rafaël Rozendaal's work -- simplifying a page of content so it is solely comprised of a series of boxes reminds me of the physical changes I've been making in my life to which I just referred above. Moving back online, I feel like I'm constantly being bombarded with content of varying forms, all competeing for my attention in one split second. I'm tired of sifting through ads, pop-ups, junk articles, and photos of my friend's dog just to check the weather, read an article, or connect a friend. The web is a like the craft beer industry: oversaturated. I'd like to take greater control of when, where, and how I'm absorbing content. It's time to trim the fat and put the noise cancelling headphones on.

              <div class="contentfour">Yesterday I spent time reviewing some of the JavaScript examples that were shared with the class. The websites that interested me most were the <a href="https://aarati.me/project.html?project=project-flight-simulator-pins" target="blank">Flight Simulator Pins</a> and <a href="https://weathergradient.com/" target="blank">Weather Gradient</a> sites. Both featured a unique application of color and were informed by data from areas in which I am interested; weather and geography. The Flight Simulator Pins, in particuarly, resonated with me because of its unique, repetitive, pattern-like output. <br><br> As early as Middle School, I remember being interested in pattern and repitition, which at the time I began exploring via tesselations in math class. Math had always been challening for me, but our unit on tesselations I adored. The visual component of it made sense to me. We even used a computer program to mock up tesselations based on basic code we developed. By inputing angle and size measurements, we were able to create a spread comprised of concentric cirlces, stars, and flower-like shapes on the page at the click of a button. <br><br>In high school, I was an "art major", which meant that I had the luxury of taking art five times a week in place of a more traditional course such as chemistry or history. For my final project during my junior year, I created a 3'x4' collage of La Boca, Argentina, a colorful neighborhood in Buenos Aires that I had visited a year prior. The collage was comprised of 1cm x 1cm squares, which I spent hours cutting out from magazines (with the help of my mom). The end result was a piece that from afar resemebled a colorful painting, while up close resembled a pixelated photograph. I spent 80 hours making it, and today, it hangs above my family's dining room table in Baltimore. I mention this piece because it represented another key moment in my artistic development in which I continued exploring the use of pattern repitition in my work.<br><br> Using JavaScript to develop generative design aligns with my past exploration with pattern and repition. But what I'm really excited about is further exploring how data can inform my design. Its like modern-day morse code. Three dots could make an S appear on the page <b>or</b> when its 72 degrees in Baltimore an S could appear page. Personally, I think the latter is more exciting. Plus, who doesn't love a good key to help them uncover meaning.
