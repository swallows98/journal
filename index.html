                <div class="contentone">Excited to see what this semester will bring. My experience with JavaScript is limited, so I'm hoping I continue to become more comfortable with the language this semester. Prior to last fall, the idea of "coding" had always been very intimidating. At my first job in marketing after my undergraduate studies at Hamilton College, I learned some very very basic html for our e-Blasts. Two years later, I moved to NYC where I landed a role in sales for an influencer marketing company. I befriended many of the members on the product team whose chatter regarding their work sounded like a foreign language to me. However, upon learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript last semester, I realized that in fact, I too, could learn a new language. And maybe one day I can parktake in those conversations.

What I enjoyed most about designing via HTML and CSS last semester was practicing how to design effectively within the limitations of HMTL and CSS. My background is painting, which is loosey goosey and allows for endless number of strokes, colors, layers, etc.  Have restaints in HTML and CSS forced me to focus on concept while executing the idea via a simple, functional design.

              <div class="contenttwo">Prior to today's class I knew very little about the history of the internet. A bit of information here a there, but honestly, not much. Recently, I've started thinking more and more about the impact of the internet on my own life -- particularly how it is impacting my relationships with those to whom I'm close. I'm wondering how having access to so much information is sculpting who I am and how interact with others. Because of this, the history of the internet has suddenly become much more intereting to me. I had no idea these massive computers lived at Google. The idea that a little fan turns on every time I create a Google slide or send an email is nearly incomprehensible, just because of how frequently I perform these tasks.

              <div class="contentthree">I am obsessed with Rafaël Rozendaal's Abstract Browsing concept. His idea was so simple, yet so effective. I recently became interested in the concept of minimalism after moving into my own apartment for the first time last fall. I had the opportunity to decorate my apartment, a 420 sq foot studio with four floor to ceiling windows looking out onto all of Brooklyn south of South 1st Street. The space gets fantastic light and has ample storage space, which has allowed me to store non-essentials while keeping my living space tidy. What I've enjoyed most, though, has been the opportunity to carefully decorate and curate a space designed entirely by me. As a painter, I've had a tendency throughout most of my life to fill my spaces with lots stuff, including piles of art supplies. I'm naturally a non-linear thinking, which means that the excess clutter throughout my life has further muffled my ability to take care of day to day tasks efficently and with ease. For example. When I need to brush my teeth, I'll walk to the bathroom, but then get distracted by the book I left on my nightstand and then by the plant hanging from my wall that needs watering (immediately). Oh no, and I just received a text from a classmate about an assingment that I should probably respond to ASAP so I don't forget about it. By the time I've reached the bathroom, I've watered my plant, responded to the text, and my book is somehow in my left hand. Here we are, toothbrush in mouth, 10 minutes later. <br><br>  I can't help but believe my design studies, which intersected with my move last fall, have contributed to my interest in minimalism. Functionality is a key element of design and as well as specificially in minimalism. So, in order to embark on my minimalism journey, I've been attempting to get rid of things I dont use, remove distractions from life i.e., setting screen time limits on my phone, and getting creative with the way I utilize my 420 sq feet. Wall storage is a must.<br><br> Now, I've mentioned all of this because Rafaël Rozendaal's work -- simplifying a page of content so it is solely comprised of a series of boxes reminds me of the physical changes I've been making in my life to which I just referred above. Moving back online, I feel like I'm constantly being bombarded with content of varying forms, all competeing for my attention in one split second. I'm tired of sifting through ads, pop-ups, junk articles, and photos of my friend's dog just to check the weather, read an article, or connect a friend. The web is a like the craft beer industry: oversaturated. I'd like to take greater control of when, where, and how I'm absorbing content. It's time to trim the fat and put the noise cancelling headphones on.

              </div>
              <div class="contentfour">Yesterday I spent time reviewing some of the JavaScript examples that were shared with the class. The websites that interested me most were the <a href="https://aarati.me/project.html?project=project-flight-simulator-pins" target="blank">Flight Simulator Pins</a> and <a href="https://weathergradient.com/" target="blank">Weather Gradient</a> sites. Both featured a unique application of color and were informed by data from areas in which I am interested; weather and geography. The Flight Simulator Pins, in particuarly, resonated with me because of its unique, repetitive, pattern-like output. <br><br> As early as Middle School, I remember being interested in pattern and repitition, which at the time I began exploring via tesselations in math class. Math had always been challening for me, but our unit on tesselations I adored. The visual component of it made sense to me. We even used a computer program to mock up tesselations based on basic code we developed. By inputing angle and size measurements, we were able to create a spread comprised of concentric cirlces, stars, and flower-like shapes on the page at the click of a button. <br><br>In high school, I was an "art major", which meant that I had the luxury of taking art five times a week in place of a more traditional course such as chemistry or history. For my final project during my junior year, I created a 3'x4' collage of La Boca, Argentina, a colorful neighborhood in Buenos Aires that I had visited a year prior. The collage was comprised of 1cm x 1cm squares, which I spent hours cutting out from magazines (with the help of my mom). The end result was a piece that from afar resemebled a colorful painting, while up close resembled a pixelated photograph. I spent 80 hours making it, and today, it hangs above my family's dining room table in Baltimore. I mention this piece because it represented another key moment in my artistic development in which I continued exploring the use of pattern repitition in my work.<br><br> Using JavaScript to develop generative design aligns with my past exploration with pattern and repition. But what I'm really excited about is further exploring how data can inform my design. Its like modern-day morse code. Three dots could make an S appear on the page <b>or</b> when its 72 degrees in Baltimore an S could appear page. Personally, I think the latter is more exciting. Plus, who doesn't love a good key to help them uncover meaning.

              <div class="contentfive">A few weeks ago I watched the Social Dilemma on Netflix, which discusses the many ways technology, particularly social media sites are destructive to humanity. If the show intended to scare people, it certainly succeeded. After watching it, I immediately set phone limits for my social media and news apps for the majority of the day with the hope my cold turkey approach would break my addiction.<br><br>Although these have been working, I’ve still found that at the end of the day, when the restrictions have been lifted, I mindlessly scroll through each of them, looking for absolutely nothing in particular other than some easy entertainment and feeling of connectedness that I have lost since the start of the pandemic.<br><br>These days are certainly lonely, so I am grateful for the apps that exists that has allowed me to connect with my family and friends like FaceTime and Zoom. Other apps that have helped with my mental health include Calm, Audible, Spotify and Peloton. I was pleasantly surprised to see these apps listed in the The Center for Humane Technology study that Frank Chimero included in his essay, The Good Room. I guess I am not alone in gravitating towards health and art apps.<br><br>But then, I think to myself, what if I didn’t have any apps? Would I need Calm, Audible, Spotify, and Peloton if Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok weren’t in my life? In non-pandemic times, I’d find community via in-person hangouts, dinners, and parties. I’d go to concerts to listen to music and probably read more books. I likely wouldn’t feel the anxiety I’ve developed over the past year, so Calm wouldn’t be necessary for me to use. And Peloton wouldn’t be essential if I could go to a gym and take a class with other humans, in person. <br><br>Yet, here I am. Trying to keep my head above water in the middle of a pandemic. And the apps I am clinging to are indeed a life raft these days. And I imagine they will continue to be for the near future. What happens beyond that point, I don’t know. But I am aligned with Chimero in that following the pandemic, I want to pivot back to a life where I appreciate the present and that which is physically tangible. If I use my phone, I want it to enhance my non-screen experiences. Use it to find a book to read. Then buy the hard copy and read the book. I want to go back to working in coffee shops and libraries, which I’ll find using Foursquare or The Infatuation.<br><br>I’m looking forward to feeling like I can take control and creating a world in which I feel more consistently happy.

              <div class="contentsix">While I was conducting research for my generative web project this week, I suddenly found myself nose diving into a Reddit rabbit hole. I first learned about Reddit five years ago upon starting my first real world job. My colleague, the company’s graphic designer, would occasionally mention things she had found on Reddit, but truthfully, I paid little attention to what she shared.Only recently did I realize the treasure trove that is Reddit. Two recent/current events prompted my interest in it; the GameStop frenzy and the COVID-19 pandemic. Less than a month ago when GameStop made headlines, I realized there was huge community of people sharing stock tips that I had previous discovered on apps like TikTok and via more traditional, reputable sources like Seeking Alpha and The Wall Street Journal. Nearly a week later, I discovered a Reddit feed for New Yorkers looking for the best way to get a vaccine appointment. A golden discovery. I mention the above because I’m pumped to be a member of the Reddit community now. It’s subculture with which I was completely unfamiliar. And now I’m realizing how much information exists within it. I’ve started using it to research concepts for my generative web project. And I’m sure it’ll come in handy with problem solving, research, and creative inspiration moving forward.

              <div class="contentseven">I enjoyed aspects of Silvio Lorusso’s essay, “the User Condition: Computer Agency and Behavior,” mostly in that it was a reminder of the lack agency we have when using devices. As I’ve mentioned in previous blog posts, I have been actively trying to reduce my social media and app use recently, but have struggled tremendously with it. Even after turning on app limits on my phone, I still find myself endless scrolling on Instagram and Facebook as I absorb content tailored to my buying habits and interests. I’ve most recently been targeted by every D2C swimwear company on the planet in my Instagram ads. This happens annually around this time of year. I click on one and every other in-feed post or story is a swimwear ad. They’ve got me. And I am powerless. I can’t wait to have a social life again so that I can finally ween myself off of social media via in-person interaction. And then I want to dump my phone and get a walkie talkie.

              <div class="contenteight">The articles that John has shared with us in this class have made me feel like I’ve been living in another dimension for my entire life. The niche websites and blogpost about the internet that we are reeding have opened up an entirely new space for me to explore. For example, the American Artist essay, “Black Gooey Universe” may have been written in a completely foreign language. I had never heard of a graphical user interface (GUI) prior to the reading and even after having finished reading the essay am still a bit bewildered by it. What I’m really fascinated by is the early development of computers and initial choices that were made that have propelled us to where we are today in terms of the function and design of computers. Before reading this essay, I had never thought about the development of the computer interface and decision making around screen color. Honestly, “Black gooey” sounded more like a way to describe tar or old mascara than it did a computer interface. Excited to be immersed in this new space and better understand its complexity.

              <div class="contentnine">I found “Concept Design Games Book Two: Playing” quite interesting, particularly regarding its relationship to coding. The second game, through which verbal commands were given to the “doer” made me think about the various ways we communicate to a computer via code. As I’ve been exploring ways to execute my final project in class, I’ve been told there are numerous ways to code more or less the same thing. What’s interesting about my experience is that the computer will interpret many different sets of directions and respond with an identical output for each. This is in comparison to the game example, in which two humans communicate via a broad set of guidelines and interpretation of the “talkers” directions may greatly vary based on who the “doer” is and the way they interpret the “talker.”<br><br>When it comes to communication design, the result of this exercise is also intriguing. It seems to serve as an example of how design is flawed. If your design isn’t clear enough, the user isn’t going to understand how to interpret it the way the designer intended. But if the design is too specific, the viewer will likely understand, but not be interested or amused by it. Boring design has its purpose, such as for signage on a highway — where function trumps aesthetic, but in other settings design is a careful merging of function and aesthetic.

I hate thinking that the internet enabled millions of people to more easily conduct extramarital affairs than they’d be able to within their immediate community. The fact that these individuals had their personal data hacked and leaked feels ironic, but quite sad, especially for those who may have taken their life due to it or for family members of those who had conducted affairs. Democratizing the internet seems like the a great solution to preventing major breaches of data and enabling users to utilize the internet with less fear, even if those individuals have poor intentions.
